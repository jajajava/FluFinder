# FluFinder
FluFinder is a web app that allows users to view an interactive map or one of several charts visualizing a table of raw data provided by the CDC regarding the bird flu. The goal my team had in mind when designing FluFinder was to bridge raise public awareness, bridge the gapÂ between raw CDC data and real-world decision making for farmers and policy makers, and to create an app that could be used to identify trends that would prevent the culling of thousands more animals.

## Findings with FluFinder - April 2025
- Outbreaks are most commonly reported in the Northwestern US, suggesting a regional hotspot that
may benefit from increased monitoring and resource allocation.

- Approximately 60% of outbreaks affect poultry hosts, while the remaining 40% involve non-poultry hosts.

- Outbreak frequency and severity are lowest during the summer months, with July typically showing the fewest and least severe cases nationwide. This trend can help improve preparedness planning.
